# demo_globals

Demo scripts to demonstrate scopes and overriding in python.

## try these in order

Read the programs and then execute them under the python interpreter.

* try_1st_access_within_function.py
* try_2nd_access_variable_in_packages.py
* try_3rd_override_variables_in_packages.py
* try_4th_explicit_override_by_calling_function.py
* try_5th_functions_within_functions.py
* try_6th_python3_nonlocal.py vs try_7th_python_inner_function.py showcases nonlocal keyword in python3.

## How scope rules work?

At any time during execution, there are at least three nested scopes whose namespaces are directly 
accessible:

1. the innermost scope, which is searched first, contains the local names.
  * Like any variable you define inside the function.

2. the scopes of any enclosing functions, which are searched starting with the nearest enclosing scope
  * If you define a function within a function, the inner function will get access the nearest outer
  function defined variable.

3. the next-to-last scope contains the current moduleâ€™s global names
  * Variables that are defined in the module at the level.
  
4.the outermost scope (searched last) is the namespace containing built-in names.
  * Things like len(), abs() etc.
